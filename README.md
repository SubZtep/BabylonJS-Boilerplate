# BabylonJS Boilerplate

:construction: This is a **[BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com) 3D WebGL engine** starter template for development with **ES6** import/export, **Webpack**, **Pug** and **SCSS**. It's under construction, any changes are possible in the future. *PRs are welcome!* :blush:

## Usage

First of all install **[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) package manager** on your system, if missing. You will download all the required packages with it. Clone or download this repository and open it in a console.

#### Available Commands

* `yarn` - Install all dependencies
* `yarn dev` - Compile the project in development mode
* `yarn watch` - Watch files, compile any changes in real time (this is your main command)

*Additional commands are coming once I setup Webpack properly.*

## File Structure

* `src/js/main.js` - Entry point
* `src/pug/index.pug` - Html template
* `src/scss/main.scss` - Css
* `dist/` - Target folder
